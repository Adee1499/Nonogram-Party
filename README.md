# Nonogram Party
Repository for some Unity assets for the Nonogram Party project as well as Python scripts used in level generation. Nonogram Party is a single and multiplayer mobile game I am currently developing in Unity, in collaboration with a team of graphic designers in Italy. It's targeted mainly at the Android platform but with success potentially also ported to iOS.

Nonograms (also known as picross, paint-by-numbers, or griddlers) are logic puzzles in which cells must be coloured according to numbers around the grid, revealing a hidden picture.
